This repo covers a topology optimization case study which is specifically run for a underwater robot. Robot has 6 motors in its periphery according to the mechanical design: 
- 4 of them are located in corners so that it moves in horizantal plane.
- 2 of them in sides so that its elevation changes below water surface.

Topology optimization is applied to motor holders connecting motors to body.
Even though topologically optimized body is not verified via Computational Fluid Dynamic Simulations, it is expected to cause lower drag force because of its more 'natural' and smooth shape.
