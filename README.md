### Freshman year project. 
As a member in a student team whose aim is to develop a autonomuos underwater vehicle accomplishing predetermined tasks.

This repository documents a topology optimization case study specifically conducted for an underwater robot. The robot features a mechanical design with six strategically positioned motors:
- Four motors are located at the corners to control submerged elevation.
- Two motors are positioned on the sides to enable horizontal plane motion.

Topology optimization is applied to motor holders using NTopology Software:
- Preserving the cylindrical contact region between the motor holders and the main body to ensure proper assembly and structural integrity.
- Applying normal forces to the propeller regions to simulate real-world operational conditions.

Although the topologically optimized design has not yet been validated through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, it is anticipated to reduce drag forces due to its more
streamlined and natural shape. This optimization aims to improve the AUV's overall performance and energy efficiency during underwater operations.
